{
	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "ht",
		"body": [
			// "#include<iostream>",
			"#include<bits/stdc++.h>",
			"#define ll long long int"
			"#define vl vector <ll>"
			"#define fr(a,b,c) for(int a=b; a<c; a++)"
			"#define all(c) (c).begin(),(c).end()"
			"using namespace std;\n"
			"int main(){\n"
			"\t$2\n"
			"\treturn 0;\n"
			"}"
